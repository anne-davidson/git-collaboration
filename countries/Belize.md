## interesting trivia
Belize became the first country in the world to completely ban bottom trawling in December 2010.[54][55] In December 2015, Belize banned offshore oil drilling within 1 km (0.6 mi) of the Barrier Reef.[56]

Despite these protective measures, the reef remains under threat from oceanic pollution as well as uncontrolled tourism, shipping, and fishing. Other threats include hurricanes, along with global warming and the resulting increase in ocean temperatures,[57] which causes coral bleaching. It is claimed by scientists that over 40% of Belize's coral reef has been damaged since 1998.[51]
